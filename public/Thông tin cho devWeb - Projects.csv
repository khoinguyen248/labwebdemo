[Olympic AI HCMC 2025],Mushrooms classification using Mutual Learning,First Prize,"Võ Văn Thịnh, Nguyễn Duy Tân, Nguyễn Trần Anh Quân, Trần Minh Huy",,"We developed an image classification model for identifying mushroom species, including shiitake, white reishi, king oyster, and straw mushrooms. The proposed approach leverages mutual learning between EfficientNet and ResNet architectures to enhance performance, achieving competitive results and securing first place overall.",https://github.com/ThinhVan27/OAI_2025-EEIoT_newbie,,,
[IoT Challenge 2025] ,Smart Cart Shopping System with IoT and Edge AI,TOP20,"Nguyễn Thị Phương Hiền,
 Nguyễn Duy Tân,Lâm Gia Bảo, Nguyễn Bá Thao, Trần Hoài An",,"The core hardware was provided by the organizers and included Silicon Labs devices and an embedded computing platform. Images captured by the camera were transmitted to the embedded system for processing, with results displayed on a web interface. Products with barcodes were automatically added to the virtual shopping cart, while weight-based items were handled via an integrated automatic weighing system. The system also supported voice-controlled lighting to assist camera operation and utilized an independent power supply.
A functional system prototype was successfully developed. However, due to unforeseen technical challenges, the system exhibited relatively high latency, and several planned features could not be fully implemented within the given timeframe. In addition, IoT-specific functionalities were not fully differentiated, and the role of Edge AI was not yet clearly demonstrated.",https://github.com/hinbon/IoTC-2025.git,,,
[Intel AI Tranning 2025],Smart Vision - WEIGHTPRO,Runner Up Prize,"Nguyễn Hoàng Triều, Tăng Phồn Thịnh, Hoàng Trung Kiên",,"An AI-based system for automatic shrimp counting and classification on a conveyor belt.
Notably, the system was successfully deployed on the Intel UP4000 board using the OpenVINO toolkit, enabling direct execution of AI models on a real-world IoT platform. The proposed solution demonstrated strong practical feasibility by accurately counting, classifying, and estimating shrimp weight on the conveyor belt with high accuracy and low latency, thereby optimizing operational costs and improving overall productivity.",,,,
[HCMC AI Challenge2025],Video Retrieval System,The Final Round,"Võ Văn Thịnh, Nguyễn Minh Khôi, Trần Minh Huy, Nguyễn Trần Anh Quân, Nguyễn Duy Tân",,"We designed and developed an event retrieval system using a video dataset provided by the organizers. The proposed system supports multiple retrieval modalities, including semantic-based search, object-based search, and OCR-based search. In addition, the team introduced several enhancements such as adaptive frame-cut thresholding and time-aware event retrieval algorithms. The system demonstrated strong performance in event search and localization during the final competition round, and the associated research paper was accepted for publication at the SOICT 2025 conference.",https://github.com/ThinhVan27/AIC-2025,,,
