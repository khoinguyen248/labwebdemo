12/2025,Enhanced Multimodal Video Retrieval System: Integrating Query Expansion and Cross-modal Temporal Event Retrieval,Conference: The 14th International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology (SOICT 2025),"Võ Văn Thịnh, Nguyễn Minh Khôi, Trần Minh Huy, Nguyễn Trần Anh Quân, Nguyễn Duy Tân, Nguyễn Khánh Lợi, Phan Anh Minh","Multimedia information retrieval from videos remains a challenging problem. While recent systems have advanced multimodal search through semantic, object, and OCR queries - and can retrieve temporally consecutive scenes - they often rely on a single query modality for an entire sequence, limiting robustness in complex temporal contexts. To overcome this, we propose a cross-modal temporal event retrieval framework that enables different query modalities to describe distinct scenes within a sequence. To determine decision thresholds for scene transition and slide change adaptively, we build Kernel Density Gaussian Mixture Thresholding (KDE-GMM) algorithm, ensuring optimal keyframe selection. These extracted keyframes act as compact, high-quality visual exemplars that retain each segment's semantic essence, improving retrieval precision and efficiency. Additionally, the system incorporates a large language model (LLM) to refine and expand user queries, enhancing overall retrieval performance. The proposed system's effectiveness and robustness were demonstrated through its strong results in the Ho Chi Minh AI Challenge 2025.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06334 (sửa lại sau khi public)
12/2021,"U-Net Semantic Segmentation of Digital Maps Using Google Satellite Images",Conference: International Conference on Emotions and Multidisciplinary Approaches (ICEMA 2021),,"Satellite images contain an enormous data warehouse and give us details to the general perspective of what is happening on the earth’s surface. These images are essential for agricultural development research, urban planning, surveying and, especially for evaluating the location design of broadcast stations, the input of coverage simulation and signal quality in telecommunications. The analysis of large amounts of complex satellite imagery is challenging while the evolving semantic segmentation approaches based on convolution neural network (CNN) can assist in analyzing this amount of data. In this paper, we introduce an approach for constructing digital maps with dataset provided by Google. We utilize the efficient U-Net architecture, which is an efficient combination of EfficientNet, namely EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder to extract the geographic features with U-Net as decoder to reconstruct the detailed features map. We evaluate our models using Google satellite images which demonstrate the efficiency in terms of Dice Loss and Categorical Cross-Entropy.",U-Net Semantic Segmentation of Digital Maps Using Google Satellite Images | IEEE Conference Publication
10/2021,"Vehicle Counting System along Specific Directions using Deep Learning",Conference: 2021 8th NAFOSTED Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS 2021),,"In this paper, we introduce a vehicle counting framework that can detect, track and count vehicles moving along the desired direction in corresponding motion-of-interests (MOIs). The suggested framework includes three main modules: vehicle detection using EfficientNet, vehicle tracking using DeepSORT and vehicle counting along MOI using trajectory matching. Experiments on our own datasets built from the videos of CCTV cameras show the robustness of the method at different light conditions with high accuracy. The proposed method achieves AP50 of 92.5% for vehicle detection and the whole video process including detection, tracking and counting can achieve up to 12fps.",vehicle counting system along specific directions using deep learning
